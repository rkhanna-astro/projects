Hey!

I am Rahul Khanna, pursuing a Masters in Astronomy at Western University. This repository is a collection of the projects I aim to do as part of my courses, research, and exploration.

I will soon add detailed explanations and installation steps for each. Please feel free to contact rkhann43@uwo.ca if you are curious to know more.

Here are the list of projects I have added as of now:
- Sound Waves propagation in a uniform-density medium
- 1-D Alfven Waves propagation
- Simulating Blast Waves

Thank You!
