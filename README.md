Hey!

I am Rahul Khanna, pursuing Masters in Astronomy at Western Univeristy. This repository is a collection of the projects I aim to do as part of my courses, research and my own exploration.

Soon I will add detailed explanation and installation steps in each. Feel free to reach out at rkhann43@uwo.ca if you are curious to know more.

Here are the list of projects I have added as of now:
- Propagation of Sound Waves

Thank You!
